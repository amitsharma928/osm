This document tries to help users with a wide range of topics, including questions and issues they may come across while using or hacking upon OSM. It tries to be as non-technical as possible, apart from when discussing technical topics. This document does not cover installation as it assumes you have everything setup.

If there's anything wrong here, or you wish to make a change/improvement, feel free to create a pull request.

Something's not working!

You may have found a bug, have a weird setup, or you may be crazy. Don't fret, I'm familiar with all three situations. If you believe you have found a bug, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/nmalcolm/osm/issues/new) and I'll look in to it. Provide as much information as possible including operating system, Node-webkit version, OSM version, how to reproduce the issue, and anything else you feel might help in fixing the issue.

You may have outdated software, an unsupported OS, or simply a bad installation. In any of these cases, I can't really help you. Upgrade your system, use a modern one, and don't screw it up. Have you tried [Xubuntu](http://xubuntu.org/)?

If you're just crazy, I won't try to reason with you. You're right. I'm wrong. My software sucks. I'll go jump in front of a train.

TBC.

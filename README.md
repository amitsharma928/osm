Open Source Media
=======

Open Source Media (or OSM) is an advanced OSINT desktop application. It allows you to search Google anonymously, using Tor or any other HTTP proxy you wish, and provides you with resources to study, inspect and audit images. An example use for this application would be to find and study illegal content with the aim to help law enforcement track down criminal(s). In reality you can use this for many different purposes.

**This software is currently unstable and probably doesn't work outside of my workstation.**

Installation
=======

OSM is available in both binary and source form.

Binaries are available for Windows, Mac, and Linux and can be downloaded here: https://github.com/nmalcolm/osm/releases

The source is available at https://github.com/nmalcolm/osm. See `HACKING` for more information. If you are unsure what to do with this, you may prefer to use a pre-built binary instead.

No installation is needed. You only need to run OSM and the rest will be taken care for you.

Facial Recognition
=======

At this time, OSM provides a limited age and gender recognition feature using OpenBR[0]. By default the gender recognition is pretty decent while the age recognition is weak at best. This feature may or may not exist in future releases depending on demand and the training which needs to be done to make this usable. If you have any experience with facial recognition and wish to help out, it would be greatly appreciated.

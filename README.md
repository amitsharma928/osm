Open Source Media
=======

Open Source Media is an advanced OSINT desktop application. It allows you to search Google anonymously, using Tor or any other HTTP proxy you wish, and provides you with resources to find, inspect and audit images. Uses include tracking down potentially illegal content which can be used to discover and help track down criminals, finding photos of specific people, and discovering new targets (e.g. an employee of a company). With Google's powerful search capabilities, Open Source Media can give you exactly what you need and lots which you don't.

Installation
=======

OSM is available in both binary and source form.

Binaries are available for Windows, Mac, and Linux and can be downloaded here: https://github.com/nmalcolm/osm/releases

The source is available at https://github.com/nmalcolm/osm. See `HACKING.md` for more information. If you are unsure what to do with this, you may prefer to use a pre-built binary instead.

No installation is needed, although packages may become available in the future.

Hacking
=======

Please see `HACKING.md`.

Help
=======

Please see `HELP.md`.

Facial Recognition
=======

At this time, OSM provides a limited age and gender recognition feature using OpenBR[0]. By default the gender recognition is pretty decent while the age recognition is weak at best. This feature may or may not exist in future releases depending on demand and the training which needs to be done to make this usable. If you have any experience with facial recognition and wish to help out, it would be greatly appreciated.
